Control keys
------------
  Control key layout for basic movement functions is topographic on 
  the left-hand side of the keyboard (an idea originating from early 
  editors and also known as "WordStar mode").
  With control keys, the important movement and editing functions are 
  always available even in unconfigured terminal environments.

HOP key
-------
  As a "key concept", the HOP key, used as a prefix key, amplifies the 
  effect of screen movement commands "just as you would expect". It 
  also works on many other commands to provide an important variation 
  of the command. This way, a richer set of commands is available 
  without having to remember too many keys. The HOP prefix function is 
  triggered by any of a number of keys, some sharing this function 
  with their own function; e.g. ^Q, ^L, ^G, ESC, the middle keypad key 
  ("5"). (The function is similar to the ^Q prefix of ancient WordStar.)

Keypad assignment
-----------------
The two cursor block keypads of typical keyboards are assigned the most 
important movement and copy/paste functions as follows:
    +-------+-------+-------+    +-------+-------+-------+
    | Insert| Home  | PgUp  |    | (7)   |  (8)  | (9)   |
    | Paste |LineBeg|       |    | Mark  |   ^   | PgUp  |
    +-------+-------+-------+    +-------+-------+-------+
    | Delete| End   | PgDn  |    | (4)   |  (5)  | (6)   |
    |Del/Cut|LineEnd|       |    | <-    |  HOP  |  ->   |
    +-------+-------+-------+    +-------+-------+-------+
                                 | (1)   |  (2)  | (3)   |
                                 | Copy  |   v   | PgDn  |
                                 +-------+-------+-------+
                                 | (0)           | (.)   |
                                 | Paste         |Del/Cut|
                                 +-------+-------+-------+

Home (right keypad) sets a mark for the text region to be selected.
End (right keypad) performs a Copy to the paste buffer.
Del: if a visual selection is active, Del performs a Cut to the paste buffer.
     otherwise, it deletes the next character right.
Home (small keypad) moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line.
End (small keypad) moves the cursor to the end of the current line.
Control-Home (both keypads) moves to the beginning of the current line.
Control-End (both keypads) moves to the end of the current line.
Control-Del (both keypads) deletes the next character.
Shift-Home (small keypad) sets a mark for the text region to be selected.
Shift-End (small keypad) performs a Copy to the paste buffer.
Shift-Del (small keypad) performs a Cut to the paste buffer.
Insert pastes the contents of the buffer to the current cursor position.

Notes:
* Ctrl-/Shift-modified keypad functions are not affected by the -k option.
  Shifted keys on the numeric keypad are usually tied to numeric digit input.
* Recognition of modified key function assignments depends on the 
  terminal and its configured mode.
  (Not all terminals support the distinction between the two keypads.)
  For xterm, this needs extra configuration. See the mined manual for 
  instructions.
* The Alt key modifies the Del, Home and End keys to perform the 
  respective other function than the plain key.

Alternate insert functions:
HOP-Insert pastes the most recent paste buffer from any instance of mined.
Alt-Insert (or ESC Insert) exchanges the pasted region just inserted 
  with the previous paste buffer inserted before.
Ctrl-Insert inserts and keeps the cursor position before the area.

The centrally placed HOP key is a prefix modifier that can be used for 
intuitive modification of navigation functions and for useful 
alternatives of paste buffer functions:
                                 +-------+-------+-------+
                                 | (7)   |  (8)  | (9)   |
                                 |go Mark|Scr top|FileBeg|
                                 +-------+-------+-------+
                                 | (4)   |  (5)  | (6)   |
                                 |LineBeg|       |LineEnd|
                                 +-------+-------+-------+
                                 | (1)   |  (2)  | (3)   |
                                 |Append |Scr bot|FileEnd|
                                 +-------+-------+-------+
                                 | (0)           | (.)   |
                                 |Cross-paste    |+Append|
                                 +-------+-------+-------+

HOP-Cursor Up/Down moves to top/bottom of screen.
HOP-Cursor Left/Right moves to beginning/end of line.
HOP-Page Up/Down moves to beginning/end of edited text.
HOP-Home moves the cursor to the marked position.
HOP-End appends to the buffer.
HOP-Del cuts and appends to the buffer.
HOP-Insert pastes the inter-session buffer.
           The inter-session buffer always contains the last copied 
           buffer by any instance of mined and remains available after 
           mined exits; so you can quickly copy and paste text between 
           two different editing sessions running mined.
           See the mined manual for further configuration hints.


Text selection
--------------
There are two ways to visually select a text area with the keyboard:
- Mark a position (using the Mark function, e.g. Home key or Control-space),
  then simply move with the normal cursor keys.
- With Windows selection compatibility option +t, initiate or continue 
  text selection with Shift-cursor keys (if supported by the terminal).


Note on the Home and End key assignments
----------------------------------------
Sometimes people expect the "Home" and "End" keys to move the cursor 
to the beginning or end of line, respectively.
In the keyboard usage approach of mined, these functions can easily 
and quite intuitively be invoked with "HOP left" and "HOP right", i.e. 
by pressing the keypad keys "5 4" or "5 6" in sequence.
So there is enough room left for mapping the most frequent paste-buffer 
functions to the keypad as described above which is considered much 
more useful.
The command line option -k exchanges Home/End function assignments of 
the two keypads with each other, including the Alt reversals.


Input methods (Keyboard mapping)
--------------------------------
Keyboard input can be mapped to support various scripts from a generic 
keyboard, including East Asian input methods. Select a script from the 
keyboard mapping menu (right-click on the "--" indication in the flags 
area, or ESC K / Alt-K / Control-F12).
Input characters or short sequences of input characters will then be 
transformed according to the selected keyboard mapping table.
Some mapping tables contain ambiguous prefixes of mapped sequences; 
in order to support this, a small delay may occur until a mapping is 
applied.
In some mapping tables, certain mappings yield multi-character sequences.
Also, certain ambiguous mappings exist that yield a multiple choice; 
it is presented in a selection menu (also known as "pick list") from 
which the desired character can be chosen by mouse click or with 
cursor keys (up / down or space / in the row, select character by 
entering its index 1-9 or 0).
