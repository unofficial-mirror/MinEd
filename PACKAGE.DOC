Guide to packaging the MinEd editor


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package contents and installation directories

A mined binary package consists of 3 or 4 groups of files:
* The binary program (mined).
  Source: src/mined
  Target: typically installed in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.
* The manual page (mined.1).
  Source: man/mined.1
  Target: typically installed below /usr/share/man, 
  /usr/local/man or /usr/local/share/man.
  The mined makefile target "install" tries to find out if the 
  system maintains any compressed manual pages and if so, 
  it compresses mined.1 too.
* The Mined runtime support library.
  For a short description of its contents, see the file README; 
  it does not contain any binary library.
  Source: usrshare/*
  Target: typically installed in /usr/share/mined, 
  /usr/share/lib/mined or /usr/local/share/mined.
* (Optional) Mined user documentation (HTML).
  Source: doc/*
  Target: typically installed in /usr/share/doc/mined.
  Traditional systems often do not maintain this kind of documentation 
  online.
  If there is no obvious place to install these files, they should 
  probably be installed in a subdirectory (help or html) of the Mined 
  runtime support library.

Older systems often have different locations to place these 
files, e.g. /usr/man, /usr/doc, /usr/local/etc, ...

The mined source package includes a number of makefiles which 
set appropriate values for different kinds of installation files on 
different systems.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Makefile support for the source distribution

The following makefile targets support publishing a mined source 
distribution:

make distribution
	This makes a mined source distribution archive 
	into the subdirectory release/.
	Before it does that, it performs two tasks:
	It checks a few things:
	- if the sources do not contain remaining debug statements
	- if the keymaps configuration file is clear of test entries
	- if all character codes listed in the character encoding 
	  tables are considered valid by the source code
	- if character input mnemonics are unambiguous
	- if the VMS link script is up-to-date
	- if the mined version is described consistently in VERSION 
	  and some other documentation files
	It updates all files:
	- it compiles mined to make sure it's compilable
	- it generates the user documentation page that lists 
	  character input mnemonics
	- it generates the online help file
	- it generates the manual page (from its HTML source)

	The make target combines make release and make lsm.

make lsm
	This generates mined.lsm, the entry for the Linux Software Map 
	(http://lsm.execpc.com/lsm/), into the subdirectory release/.

make release (or make dist)
	Make a distribution archive (like make distribution, without lsm).

make archive (or make tar)
	Like make release, but skips some integrity checking and 
	version update enforcement
	(for internal production of development and test archives).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Makefile support for package generation

make description.summary
	This generates a one-line short description for mined.

make description.medium
	This generates a medium-size description for mined.

make description.long
	This generates an overview description for mined.

make descriptions
	This combines all 3 of the above.

make rpm
	This generates only a partial mined.spec file, 
	as used with the RPM package of SuSE Linux.
	It basically contains the name and version, 
	and summary and long description entries for mined.

make cygwin
	This generates Cygwin source and binary packages, together 
	with a setup.hint file, provided that a precompiled 
	mined.exe is in the subdirectory src/, 
	into the subdirectory release/cygwin/.

make win
	This generates a Windows self-installing executable archive, 
	compiled with cygwin. The self-extracting archive is built 
	with IEXPRESS (native Windows tool).

make dos
	This generates a DOS binary zip archive, compiled with djgpp.

make vms
	This generates a VMS binary zip archive, with executables 
	for VAX, Alpha and Itanium platforms.
