For a full description of mined commands see the manual page.
Mined commands are either mapped to control keys, function keys, 
or sequences starting with the ESCape key.
Apart from cursor movement (see help on "keyboard"), the most important 
commands are:

^] or ^@ or ESC @	Set mark (to remember the current location).
			(With HOP it moves to the remembered location.)
^Y		Copy text between mark and cursor into paste buffer.
^U		Cut (move) text between mark and cursor into paste buffer.
^P		Paste contents of paste buffer to current position.
		(With HOP it pastes inter-window buffer, from other mined).
ESC b		Copy contents of buffer into a file. (Appends with HOP.)
ESC i or F4	Insert file at current cursor position.

^G or ESC g	Goto (various options, also used as HOP key).
ESC / or F8	Search. (ESC \ searches backwards.)
ESC ,		Search and replace.
ESC r		Search and replace with confirmation.
ESC R		Search and replace on current line.
ESC ESC		Save file (if needed) and exit.
ESC q		Quit, don't save (confirm if text modified).
ESC h or F1	Help.

Paragraph justification (word-wrap)
-----------------------------------
ESC <		Set left margin for justification.
ESC ;		Set left margin of first line of paragraph only.
ESC :		Set left margin of next lines of paragraph only.
ESC >		Set right margin for justification.
ESC j		Justify (word-wrap) paragraph.

Character input support
-----------------------
^V for various kinds of special character input:
^V control-char      enter the control character.
^V [, \, ], ^^, __   enter the corresponding control character.
^V <accent> <char>   enter an accented character composed accordingly.
^V # xxxx            enter character with hexadecimal value
^V # # xxxxxx        enter character with octal value
^V # = xxxxx         enter character with decimal value
^V # U ... xxxx      enter character with hex (oct/dec) Unicode value
^V <space> <name> <space> , or:
^V <char> <char>     enter character by mnemonic character name;
                     recognised mnemonics are those of RFC 1345, HTML, 
                     TeX, and supplementary mnemonics
Examples:
	"^Vae" enters the "ae" ligature
	"^V'e" enters e with accent d'aigu
	"^V ae' " enters the Latin ligature ae with acute accent
	"^V-," or "^V neg " enters the negation symbol
	"^Va*" or "^V a* " enters the Greek small letter alpha
	"^V euro " enters the Euro character
	"^V#20ac" enters the hex character value 20AC (in current encoding)
	"^V#U20ac" enters the character with Unicode value 20AC (the Euro)
If numeric input is followed by a Space, numeric input continues for 
further characters; terminate with Return/Enter.

accented letter; multiple accent prefix keys can be combined.
